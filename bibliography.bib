	abstract = {Government-backed income contingent student loans are increasingly being used to fund higher education. Until the outstanding balance is cleared, an income contingent repayment plan acts as an incremental marginal tax on earnings above a threshold. If this additional “tax” on earnings reduces the labor supply and hence the earnings of borrowers, this could reduce both loan repayments and tax receipts, increasing the cost of funding higher education. This paper investigates this under-studied topic by exploring bunching at various loan repayment thresholds between 2002 and 2014, using a novel, linked administrative dataset from the United Kingdom. Our findings suggest that the {UK}'s income contingent repayment plan does not cause borrowers to reduce labor supply, at least for those with earnings near to the threshold.},

            {BAföG} is intended to exploit educational potential and promote equal opportunities. To this end, it has two main control levers: allowances and benefit rates. However, adjustments to both figures have been determined by political debates and budgetary considerations rather than on the basis of scientific evidence on the achievement of objectives. Without a causal impact evaluation, however, neither the effectiveness nor the efficiency of the funding can be determined. In view of the objectives and the scope of the funds used (€3 billion per year), causal evaluations appear more than overdue. This article proposes a solution to this problem with five key points as an impetus for political and scientific discussion.},

Die Studierenden in diesen Ländern berichten seltener über (sehr) große finanzielle Schwierigkeiten.

	abstract = {This article aims to provide an overview of the main mechanisms underlying non-take-up by bringing together insights from existing theoretical models and the large body of empirical evidence. We draw on studies based on the traditional model of economic rationality as well as on behavioural economics. The first strand of literature is based on the assumption that individuals are perfectly rational and therefore perfectly able to optimize the trade-off between costs and benefits. The second, and more recent perspective, focuses on important deviations from the traditional assumptions of rationality by pointing to the role of cognitive biases and behavioural barriers. An important focus of attention in this article is the way policy design and administrations can affect the uptake of public provisions. While the traditional approach tends to pay little attention to the design of public provisions and the role of administrations in improving participation rates, behavioural economics has shed light on the question of how to nudge and prime people into participating in public programmes without fundamentally changing their economic incentives (e.g. simply by changing the default settings in administrative procedures). In this literature review, we bring both strands in the literature together and develop a theoretical framework which lists and links the various mechanisms at play. At the same time, we summarise the most important empirical findings, and identify gaps in the literature. Finally, we pay attention to lessons from the literature regarding how policies could be redesigned to reduce non-takeup.},
