            {BAföG} is intended to exploit educational potential and promote equal opportunities. To this end, it has two main control levers: allowances and benefit rates. However, adjustments to both figures have been determined by political debates and budgetary considerations rather than on the basis of scientific evidence on the achievement of objectives. Without a causal impact evaluation, however, neither the effectiveness nor the efficiency of the funding can be determined. In view of the objectives and the scope of the funds used (€3 billion per year), causal evaluations appear more than overdue. This article proposes a solution to this problem with five key points as an impetus for political and scientific discussion.},

	abstract = {This article aims to provide an overview of the main mechanisms underlying non-take-up by bringing together insights from existing theoretical models and the large body of empirical evidence. We draw on studies based on the traditional model of economic rationality as well as on behavioural economics. The first strand of literature is based on the assumption that individuals are perfectly rational and therefore perfectly able to optimize the trade-off between costs and benefits. The second, and more recent perspective, focuses on important deviations from the traditional assumptions of rationality by pointing to the role of cognitive biases and behavioural barriers. An important focus of attention in this article is the way policy design and administrations can affect the uptake of public provisions. While the traditional approach tends to pay little attention to the design of public provisions and the role of administrations in improving participation rates, behavioural economics has shed light on the question of how to nudge and prime people into participating in public programmes without fundamentally changing their economic incentives (e.g. simply by changing the default settings in administrative procedures). In this literature review, we bring both strands in the literature together and develop a theoretical framework which lists and links the various mechanisms at play. At the same time, we summarise the most important empirical findings, and identify gaps in the literature. Finally, we pay attention to lessons from the literature regarding how policies could be redesigned to reduce non-takeup.},

Each step of the analysis focuses on particular aspects of programme legislation and implementation, and together the new framework will substantially improve the possibilities of research to inform policymaking. We provide an empirical illustration of our approach based on Swedish data, and highlight how our new consolidated framework for analysing benefit coverage provides a reorientation of the research agenda on benefit coverage.},

We estimate the non-take-up rate of the need-based student grant in the Netherlands and investigate which student characteristics Correlate with the non-take-up. Using administrative data on students and their parents and data on student grants, we construct an eligibility proxy for first-year students in higher education. Our calculations suggest that around one-third of all students is eligible for a need-based grant, with 12\% being eligible for the maximum amount. We find that 24\% of all eligible students do not apply for the need-based student grant. The non-take-up among students eligible for the maximum amount is lower but still substantial at 12\%. Remarkably about one-third of the non-claimants do take on a student loan while leaving the grant on the table. Our regression results show that the non-take-up of the grant is highest among students who belong to social groups which are overall less likely to be eligible. This indicates that information costs may be an important determinant of non-take-up among students.},

The analysis is based on a microsimulation model, which includes a detailed description of the German social assistance programme. Our findings suggest a moderate decrease in non-take-up compared to estimates before the reform. In order to identify the determinants of claiming social assistance, we estimate a model of take-up behaviour which considers endogeneity of the benefit level. The estimations reveal that the degree of needs, measured as the social assistance benefit level a household is eligible for, and the expected duration of eligibility are the key determinants of the take-up decision, while costs of claiming seem to play a minor role.},

According to our simulation as much as 67 percent of the eligible population did not claim SA in that year which is slightly higher than reported in previous work. We particularly emphasize the role of measurement error in estimating non-take-up. First, we consider misspecifications of the simulation model due, e.g., to households claiming to have received SA although not simulated as eligible ("beta-error"). Second, we employ sensitivity analyses revealing the impact of measurement errors in reported household income and wealth as well as in simulated needs. Misreported household incomes appear to have the greatest impact on the estimated non-take-up rates, as shown in Monte-Carlo-type simulations. Regression analysis of the potential determinants of non-take-up behaviour confirm that rational motives - i.e., the expected net utility from claiming - as well as stigma and other barriers play a crucial role in explaining the puzzle of large non-take-up rates of SA.},

	abstract = {In many European countries, about half of those eligible for means-tested social benefits, do not receive the benefits to which they are entitled. In the literature, a wide range of factors have been identified that potentially contribute to the non-take-up of social benefits. Particular attention has been paid to factors that relate to the claimants themselves, including the experienced or perceived costs associated with claiming benefits and negative attitudes towards claiming benefits. However, the theory on the conditions under which claiming costs matter is still underdeveloped, while the evidence on the relative importance of claiming costs is to a large extent indirect and based on proxy variables. In this paper, we measure individual and household (dis)incentives for taking up social assistance benefits more directly, and evaluate to what extent they are associated with non-take-up of social assistance for people at active age in Belgium. To do so, we use a combination of register data and data from the TAKE survey, a new representative survey tailored for studying the determinants of non-take-up in Belgium. Combining both sources of information and detailed simulations of eligibility, we show that information costs are much better at predicting non-receipt of social assistance than process costs and stigma. While attitudes towards the receipt of benefits are of little consequence, optimism about the future seems to matter more, as does the level of material deprivation experienced by the household. We also explore under what conditions information costs matter most. While findings are not very robust, our data suggest that the importance of information costs is mediated by the level optimism about the future and changes in household composition that act as trigger events.},
