	abstract = {Government-backed income contingent student loans are increasingly being used to fund higher education. Until the outstanding balance is cleared, an income contingent repayment plan acts as an incremental marginal tax on earnings above a threshold. If this additional “tax” on earnings reduces the labor supply and hence the earnings of borrowers, this could reduce both loan repayments and tax receipts, increasing the cost of funding higher education. This paper investigates this under-studied topic by exploring bunching at various loan repayment thresholds between 2002 and 2014, using a novel, linked administrative dataset from the United Kingdom. Our findings suggest that the {UK}'s income contingent repayment plan does not cause borrowers to reduce labor supply, at least for those with earnings near to the threshold.},

            {BAföG} is intended to exploit educational potential and promote equal opportunities. To this end, it has two main control levers: allowances and benefit rates. However, adjustments to both figures have been determined by political debates and budgetary considerations rather than on the basis of scientific evidence on the achievement of objectives. Without a causal impact evaluation, however, neither the effectiveness nor the efficiency of the funding can be determined. In view of the objectives and the scope of the funds used (€3 billion per year), causal evaluations appear more than overdue. This article proposes a solution to this problem with five key points as an impetus for political and scientific discussion.},

The second, and more recent perspective, focuses on important deviations from the traditional assumptions of rationality by pointing to the role of cognitive biases and behavioural barriers. An important focus of attention in this article is the way policy design and administrations can affect the uptake of public provisions. While the traditional approach tends to pay little attention to the design of public provisions and the role of administrations in improving participation rates, behavioural economics has shed light on the question of how to nudge and prime people into participating in public programmes without fundamentally changing their economic incentives (e.g. simply by changing the default settings in administrative procedures). In this literature review, we bring both strands in the literature together and develop a theoretical framework which lists and links the various mechanisms at play. At the same time, we summarise the most important empirical findings, and identify gaps in the literature.

We estimate the non-take-up rate of the need-based student grant in the Netherlands and investigate which student characteristics Correlate with the non-take-up. Using administrative data on students and their parents and data on student grants, we construct an eligibility proxy for first-year students in higher education. Our calculations suggest that around one-third of all students is eligible for a need-based grant, with 12\% being eligible for the maximum amount. We find that 24\% of all eligible students do not apply for the need-based student grant. The non-take-up among students eligible for the maximum amount is lower but still substantial at 12\%. Remarkably about one-third of the non-claimants do take on a student loan while leaving the grant on the table. Our regression results show that the non-take-up of the grant is highest among students who belong to social groups which are overall less likely to be eligible. This indicates that information costs may be an important determinant of non-take-up among students.},

Our findings suggest a moderate decrease in non-take-up compared to estimates before the reform. In order to identify the determinants of claiming social assistance, we estimate a model of take-up behaviour which considers endogeneity of the benefit level. The estimations reveal that the degree of needs, measured as the social assistance benefit level a household is eligible for, and the expected duration of eligibility are the key determinants of the take-up decision, while costs of claiming seem to play a minor role.},

	abstract = {Using representative micro data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) for the year 2002, we analyse non-take-up behaviour of Social Assistance (SA) in Germany. According to our simulation as much as 67 percent of the eligible population did not claim SA in that year which is slightly higher than reported in previous work. We particularly emphasize the role of measurement error in estimating non-take-up. First, we consider misspecifications of the simulation model due, e.g., to households claiming to have received SA although not simulated as eligible ("beta-error"). Second, we employ sensitivity analyses revealing the impact of measurement errors in reported household income and wealth as well as in simulated needs. Misreported household incomes appear to have the greatest impact on the estimated non-take-up rates, as shown in Monte-Carlo-type simulations. Regression analysis of the potential determinants of non-take-up behaviour confirm that rational motives - i.e., the expected net utility from claiming - as well as stigma and other barriers play a crucial role in explaining the puzzle of large non-take-up rates of SA.},

	abstract = {In many European countries, about half of those eligible for means-tested social benefits, do not receive the benefits to which they are entitled. In the literature, a wide range of factors have been identified that potentially contribute to the non-take-up of social benefits. Particular attention has been paid to factors that relate to the claimants themselves, including the experienced or perceived costs associated with claiming benefits and negative attitudes towards claiming benefits. However, the theory on the conditions under which claiming costs matter is still underdeveloped, while the evidence on the relative importance of claiming costs is to a large extent indirect and based on proxy variables. In this paper, we measure individual and household (dis)incentives for taking up social assistance benefits more directly, and evaluate to what extent they are associated with non-take-up of social assistance for people at active age in Belgium. To do so, we use a combination of register data and data from the TAKE survey, a new representative survey tailored for studying the determinants of non-take-up in Belgium. Combining both sources of information and detailed simulations of eligibility, we show that information costs are much better at predicting non-receipt of social assistance than process costs and stigma. While attitudes towards the receipt of benefits are of little consequence, optimism about the future seems to matter more, as does the level of material deprivation experienced by the household. We also explore under what conditions information costs matter most. While findings are not very robust, our data suggest that the importance of information costs is mediated by the level optimism about the future and changes in household composition that act as trigger events.},

abstract = {"In 2010, the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) declared the level of social assistance according to the Second and Twelfth Book of the Social Code (SGB II and SGB XII) in its form at that time as non-constitutional. In response to the verdict the 'Regelbedarfs-Ermittlungsgesetz' (RBEG) was adopted. In the political discussion of the RBEG the question remained whether in determining the level of social assistance, households can be excluded from the calculations that do not claim social assistance despite being entitled. Such households are often described by the term 'hidden poor'. The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales) commissioned the IAB to identify hidden poor households on the basis of empirical models. In addition, the study should investigate how the exclusion of the hidden poor affects the composition of the reference groups which are the basis for determining the level of social assistance. The extent of hidden poverty was examined by using a microsimulation model developed by the IAB. The data base for the model comes from the German Income and Expenditure Survey (Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe) of 2008. The simulated non-take-up rates range from 34 % to 43 %. These rates are on the lower end of the results reported in the literature on hidden poverty, but the simulation results nevertheless suggest that non-take-up exists to a considerable extent, even after the implementation of a major social policy reform (Hartz IV reform) in 2005. The level of social assistance is determined by the reference households' level of consumption. The exclusion of the hidden poor - using otherwise unchanged calculation rules of the RBEG - leads to an increase in the newly defined reference groups' average consumption spending of roughly 2 % in single-person households and about 5 % in couple households with one child. The IAB was further mandated to investigate the effects of excluding the hidden poor on the composition of reference groups using a sequence of calculation which differs from the one currently specified in the RBEG. The alternative sequence of calculation implies a reversal of the common procedure. Low-income households are selected before households - those receiving social assistance and also the hidden poor - are excluded. As a result of this alternative sequence of calculation, the exclusion of the hidden poor does not result in an increase in average consumption in single-person households. In couple households, compared to the currently applied order of calculation, the alternative sequence of calculation results in a considerably smaller increase in average consumption of 2 %."

Treated participants were also provided with aid estimates that were compared against tuition cost amounts for nearby colleges. The combined assistance and information treatment substantially increased FAFSA submissions and ultimately the likelihood of college attendance, persistence, and aid receipt. In particular, high school seniors whose parents received the treatment were 8 percentage points more likely to have completed two years of college, going from 28\% to 36\%, during the first three years following the experiment. Families who received aid information but no assistance with the FAFSA did not experience improved outcomes.
