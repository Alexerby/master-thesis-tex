\section{Results}

\subsection{Microsimulation Non-take-up}
Our microsimulation results indicate that the non-take-up-rate of BAföG, among theoretically eligible students ranged from 50\% to 67.5\% across the survey years 2007--2021, with an average of approximately 60\%  (Table \ref{table:microsimulation-ntu}).

These estimates are broadly in line with previous findings on non-take-up of social benefits in Germany, which generally falls between 40--67\%, depending on the program and time period (see Table \ref{table:NTU-studies}). 
While our estimates are broadly consistent with prior research, they are noticeably higher than the 36--40\% non-take-up rate for BAföG reported by \cite{herber_non-take-up_2019}, who also use SOEP data for the period 2002--2013.
This discrepancy may reflect differences in the operationalization of theoretical eligibility, the time periods analyzed (with our study covering 2007--2021), or other aspects of the microsimulation and modeling approach.
