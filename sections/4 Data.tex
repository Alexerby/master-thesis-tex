\section{Data}
To estimate non-take-up rates of welfare benefits, one typically relies on one or more of three data sources: administrative records, specially designed surveys, and general purpose household surveys.
Each comes with its own trade-offs. 
Administrative data are accurate for tracking benefit receipt but usually lack information on those who do not apply. 
Special surveys can provide richer detail on eligibility and claiming behaviour, though they are costly and rarely implemented. 
General purpose surveys are more readily available and widely used in empirical research on non-take-up, even if they are not designed with this purpose in mind \citep{mechelen_who_2017}.

In line with much of the existing literature, this study relies on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), which falls into the third category of general-purpose household surveys. 
As one of the longest-standing multidisciplinary household surveys in the world, SOEP has been conducted annually since 1984 by the German Institute for Economic Research \citep{soepcore_v39}. 
It is a nationally representative longitudinal study that collects data from around 30,000 individuals in 22,000 households each year. 
The survey includes respondents aged 17 and older and provides rich individual- and household-level information on income, education, labour market activity, household structure, and demographics. 
This study uses the SOEP-Core sample, the central and most comprehensive module of the dataset. While general purpose surveys like SOEP are not specifically designed to measure non-take-up, they have the advantage of covering both benefit receipt and the before mentioned characteristics needed to estimate eligibility \citep{mechelen_who_2017}.

\subsection{Sample Description}
We restrict our analysis to the period between 2007 and 2021, as this corresponds to the range for which we were able to consistently collect and harmonize the necessary statutory parameters from official BAföG regulations \citep{bafoeg_law}. These parameters include annual updates to base need rates, income allowances, asset thresholds, and other legally defined components relevant to BAföG eligibility and award determination.\footnote{
  See Appendix \ref{appendix:simulation-example} for an example illustrating how these rules are applied.
}
Earlier years were excluded due to inconsistencies or incomplete availability of comparable legal documentation. By focusing on this window, we ensure that the simulation model is fully grounded in verifiable legal norms and accurately reflects the policy environment faced by students during this period.

The SOEP, with its detailed household structure, enables us to link students to their parents, siblings, and, in many cases, partners. Using this data, we construct a dataset combining rich information at both the student and household levels, including a wide range of socio-demographic, economic, and relational characteristics.

Our final dataset comprises \(5{,}889\) student-year observations, each representing a student in a given survey year, drawn from a harmonized sample based on SOEP-Core data spanning 2007 to 2022. The panel is unbalanced, as students are observed for varying numbers of years depending on education duration, dropout behavior, and survey participation.

While some students appear only once, others are followed across multiple years of their educational trajectory. Each observation includes comprehensive information on sociodemographic background, enrolment status, income and assets, housing situation, and reported BAföG receipt. Variables used in the simulation are consistently available throughout the entire period.

To ensure accurate simulation of BAföG eligibility and awards, we restrict the sample to students for whom we can identify income information for both parents. 

Although the SOEP survey is nationally representative, this analytic subsample is conditional on respondents enrolled in education and meeting the inclusion criteria of the simulation pipeline. A descriptive overview of key variables is provided in Appendix~\ref{appendix:variable_dictionary}, Table~\ref{table:variable_dictionary}.
