- What other studies have looked into

In broad terms, research on non take up can be split into studies applying traditional economic theory and studies applying behavioural economic theory. Traditional economic theory assumes rational behaviour and thus that agents optimise the trade off between benefit and cost. The field of behavioural economics, that has more recently emerged, instead emphasises deflections from the traditional assumptions on rational behaviour and highlights cognitive bias and behavioural obstacles \citep{mechelen_who_2017}.
