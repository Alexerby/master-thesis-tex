	abstract = {We examine several modified versions of the heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimator of Hinkley (1977) and White (1980). On the basis of sampling experiments which compare the performance of quasi t-statistics, we find that one estimator, based on the jackknife, performs better in small samples than the rest. We also examine the finite-sample properties of using modified critical values based on Edgeworth approximations, as proposed by Rothenberg (1984). In addition, we compare the power of several tests for heteroskedasticity, and find that it may be wise to employ the jackknife heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix even in the absence of detected heteroskedasticity.},

	abstract = {The Imhof procedure is used to calculate the exact finite-sample distributions of alternative heteroskedasticity robust Wald-type tests of scalar linear hypothesis in the normal linear model. The tests are distinguished by the variance estimator that they use. These include the White-Eicker and jackknife estimators. The calculations demonstrate the importance of regression design in determining the quality of conventional first-order asymptotic approximations to the null distributions of the tests.},
