While the body of literature on the non-take-up of public aid has grown substantially in recent years, a notable gap remains in the literature of non-take-up rates for student aid programs, where research is still extremely limited.
This paper examines the non-take-up rate of Germany’s federal student aid program BAföG by creating a microsimulation based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel for the period 2007--2021.
Using the outcome of our microsimulation, we estimate three specifications of binary choice models to examine how individual characteristics relate to take-up decisions. 
Our findings indicate that non-take-up has increased over the past decade, with an average rate of approximately 60\% for our study period. 
Two main factors help explain this phenomenon. 
First, students are less likely to apply if they expect only a small subsidy. 
Second, greater awareness and understanding of the application process appear to be associated with higher take-up rates. 
Additionally, we find a notable difference in take-up rates between East and West Germany, suggesting that attitudes toward government support may influence the take-up rate.
