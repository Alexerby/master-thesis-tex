This paper examines the non-take-up of Germany’s federal student aid program (BAföG) using microsimulation techniques based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel for the years 2007–2021. With almost a decade since non-take-up of BAföG was last analysed, our study provides updated estimates that capture recent developments. This is of relevance since the share of students that take up BAföG is reported to have decreased even further in recent years.
We simulate BAföG eligibility and compare it to observed take-up behaviour to estimate non-take-up rates. 
Our findings indicate that non-take-up has increased over the past decade, with an average rate of approximately 60\% during the study period.
Two main factors help explain this phenomenon. 
First, students are less likely to apply if they expect only a small subsidy. 
Second, greater awareness and understanding of the application process significantly increase the likelihood of take-up. 
Additionally, we find a notable difference in take-up rates between East and West Germany, suggesting that cultural attitudes toward government support may influence participation.
