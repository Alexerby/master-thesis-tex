\noindent This paper examines the non-take-up of Germany’s federal student aid program (BAföG) by creating a microsimulation based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel for the years 2007--2021. 
With almost a decade since non-take-up of BAföG was last analysed, our study provides updated estimates that capture recent developments. 
Following the microsimulation, we estimate three specifications of binary choice models to examine how individual and household characteristics relate to take-up decisions. 
Our findings indicate that non-take-up has increased over the past decade, with an average rate of approximately 60\%. 
Two main factors help explain this phenomenon. 
First, students are less likely to apply if they expect only a small subsidy. 
Second, greater awareness and understanding of the application process appear to be associated with higher take-up rates. Additionally, we find a notable difference in take-up rates between East and West Germany, suggesting that cultural attitudes toward government support may influence participation.
